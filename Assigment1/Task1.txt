Assessment Tasks: AWS Theoretical and Practical Concepts Evaluation
Scenario:
Yoobee College of Creative Innovation is undergoing a digital transformation to enhance its academic services and operational efficiency. The institution aims to move its IT infrastructure to the AWS cloud to improve scalability, reduce costs, and ensure high availability for students and staff. Currently, Yoobee College hosts learning management systems, student databases, and faculty applications on on-premises servers, which face performance bottlenecks and security challenges.
The college plans to implement a server-based virtualization infrastructure using AWS services to address these issues. The new cloud infrastructure should meet the following key requirements:
• Cost-effectiveness: Optimize cloud expenses while ensuring resource availability.
• Scalability: Support increasing student enrolment and faculty requirements.
• Security: Ensure compliance with best security practices to protect academic and student data.
• High Availability: Implement redundancy and load balancing to maintain uninterrupted services.
As a Cloud Solutions Engineer, you evaluate, design, implement, and optimize Yoobee College's cloud-based server virtualization infrastructure. Your role involves both theoretical assessments and hands-on AWS implementation to ensure the cloud environment meets industry standards and institutional goals.
Note: You can use an example of 5 on-premises computer systems at Yoobee College of Creative Innovation to illustrate the adoption of an AWS-based cloud infrastructure.
(Learning management systems = 2 servers | Staff (Facutly) Application = 2 servers |Students Database = 1 system)
Task 1: Theoretical Evaluation: Cloud-Based Virtualization Solution.
1. Identify Yoobee College’s key cloud infrastructure requirements for cost, scalability, security, and high availability.
2. Compare at least two AWS pricing models (e.g., On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot Instances) and recommend the most cost-effective option.
3. Analyze how AWS services like Auto Scaling and Load Balancing can help improve application availability and performance.
4. Provide a brief report of 800-1000 words (+/- 10% allowed) summarizing your findings and justifying your recommendations.
Deliverables:
A structured report (PDF format only) with:
• Key infrastructure requirements
• Comparison of AWS pricing models
• Explanation of Auto Scaling and Load Balancing benefits
• Justification for the recommended approach
