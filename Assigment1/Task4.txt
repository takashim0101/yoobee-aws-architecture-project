Assessment Tasks: AWS Theoretical and Practical Concepts Evaluation
Scenario:
Yoobee College of Creative Innovation is undergoing a digital transformation to enhance its academic services and operational efficiency. The institution aims to move its IT infrastructure to the AWS cloud to improve scalability, reduce costs, and ensure high availability for students and staff. Currently, Yoobee College hosts learning management systems, student databases, and faculty applications on on-premises servers, which face performance bottlenecks and security challenges.
The college plans to implement a server-based virtualization infrastructure using AWS services to address these issues. The new cloud infrastructure should meet the following key requirements:
• Cost-effectiveness: Optimize cloud expenses while ensuring resource availability.
• Scalability: Support increasing student enrolment and faculty requirements.
• Security: Ensure compliance with best security practices to protect academic and student data.
• High Availability: Implement redundancy and load balancing to maintain uninterrupted services.
As a Cloud Solutions Engineer, you evaluate, design, implement, and optimize Yoobee College's cloud-based server virtualization infrastructure. Your role involves both theoretical assessments and hands-on AWS implementation to ensure the cloud environment meets industry standards and institutional goals.
Note: You can use an example of 5 on-premises computer systems at Yoobee College of Creative Innovation to illustrate the adoption of an AWS-based cloud infrastructure.
(Learning management systems = 2 servers | Staff (Facutly) Application = 2 servers |Students Database = 1 system)

Task 4: Theoretical and Practical Evaluation: Optimization and Security
1. Apply AWS security best practices (e.g., Security Groups, IAM roles, MFA, and encryption) to secure the cloud environment.
2. Configure AWS CloudWatch for monitoring EC2 instances and setting up alerts for resource utilization.
3. Optimize cost using AWS Trusted Advisor recommendations and provide a cost-reduction strategy.
4. Present your security and cost-optimization recommendations in a structured report.
Note: Due to the limitations of the AWS Free Tier subscription, the AWS Trusted Advisor service will be explored through theoretical analysis and research-based discussion, supported by relevant academic and industry references.
Deliverables:
• A security configuration document (only PDF format) with:
 List of AWS security best practices implemented
 IAM roles, Security Groups, and MFA setup details
• Screenshots (PNG or JPEG format) of:
 AWS CloudWatch monitoring setup
 Cost optimization analysis using AWS Trusted Advisor
• A final structured report summarizing security enhancements and cost reduction strategies.
• Evaluate the report’s clarity, depth, and thoroughness.
